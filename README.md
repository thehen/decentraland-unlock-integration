## Unlock Protocol Decentraland Integration

A simple interactive scene with a locked door preventing access to a building. Once a membership is purchased through Unlock Protocol, you are granted access to the building.

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Previewing the scene**

Download this example and navigate to its directory, then run:

```
$:  dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab.

To then enable web3, append `?ENABLE_WEB3` to the url.
